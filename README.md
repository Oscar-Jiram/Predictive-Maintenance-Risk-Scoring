# Predictive-Maintenance-Risk-Scoring
Operational risk scoring project for predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments.  Using the AI4I 2020 dataset, this project builds a data-driven risk score to classify machine operating conditions into Low, Medium, and High risk, enabling maintenance teams to prioritize inspections and reduce unplanned downtime.
